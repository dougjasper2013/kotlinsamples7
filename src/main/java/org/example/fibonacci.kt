// a fibonacci number is the sum of the previous 2 fibonacci numbers
// The fibonacci of 0 is 0
// The fibonacci of 1 is 1
// From now on the fibonacci of a number is the sum of the previous 2 fibonacci numbers
// For instance the fibonacci of 2 is 1 + 0 which equals 1
// Next the fibonacci of 3 is the sum of the fibonacci of 2 and the fibonacci of 1 which is 2
// Next the fibonacci of 4 is the sum of the fibonacci of 3 and the fibonacci of 2 which is 3

// Next the fibonacci of 5 is the sum of the fibonacci of 4 and the fibonacci of 3 which is 5
// And so on ...
